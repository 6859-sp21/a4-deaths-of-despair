# **Deaths of Despair**

## **Context**

The goal of our project was to shed light on a ground-breaking economics paper by Anne Case and Angus Deaton. Case and Deaton first showed in 2015 that an increase in “deaths of despair” - defined as deaths related to drug and alcohol poisoning, suicide, and alcoholism-related liver disease - had challenged decades of decreases in overall US mortality rates. At the time of their study (1999-2013), these increases were specific to non-hispanic White Americans and they were not observed in other rich countries.
